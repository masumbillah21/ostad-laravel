# Live Test 08

## Task 1:

Suppose you are sending a Form request in Laravel.

Now, create a route in Laravel that handles a POST request to the '/form-submit' URL with the following data: ‘email’ = ‘john@test.com’. Inside the route closure, retrieve the 'email' input parameter from the request and store it in a variable called $email. 

 ## Task 2:

In your Laravel application, you want to retrieve the value of the 'User-Agent' header from a GET request to ‘/user-agent’ URL. 

Write the code to accomplish this and store the value in a variable called $userAgent. Return the $userAgent as a response.
